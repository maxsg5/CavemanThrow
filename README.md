# CavemanThrow
Unity Game for Desktop and Xbox One

My first 2D unity game I am creating as a portfolio project for my resume. The game is a simple concept where you shoot moving projectiles under a time limit with the goal of trying to get the highest score possible under the given time limit.

To play on PC:

- Navigate to Build folder
- Run CavemanThrow.exe
